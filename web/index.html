          <p>The Chess-Board Game as an attribute of the Culture is well known long ago. For a long time there were
            variants of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Mongolian,Turkish and Armenian games. It is customary to consider,
            that The Tschaturangha, which was bom in India in the 4-5th centuries A.D., is an original mother of the
            modern chess-64.</p>

          <p>With the exception of the classic chess-64, many models, such as cylindrical, toroidal, circular, hexagonal
            have been elaborated. And there were Great Indian chess ( a 12x12 square board), Capablanca's chess (12x16),
            Tamerlan's chess (10x11), Bur-tsev's chess (9x9), Viena's chess (6x6) and Gardner's chess (5x5).</p>

          <p>They developed also the so called &laquo;exotic&raquo; chess-men, e.g. The Giraff, The Camel, The Zebra,
            The Centaur, The Cricket, The Lion, The Superelefant, The Maha-rajah, etc.In The United States a chess-man
            called The Atomic Bomb was patented (see E.Gyk, &laquo;Chess and Mathematics&raquo;, 1972).</p>

          <p>There are some models of 100-square chess-board games. In 1934 in Leningrad the model &laquo;Victrics&raquo;
            (the author - Mr.Petrov) was on sale. The new chess-men were The Aeroplane, The Machine-gun and The Tank. In
            the eighties the models were developed in Moscow, Baku and Odessa (the author -Mr.Perfiliev).</p>

          <p>The fact of such a presence of 100-square models variety witnesses for, that during a long period of time
            many attemps have been undertaken to find an alternative chess. And it is not accidentally, that Mr.
            Capablanca, the third world champion,who proposed his own model, told, that the classic chess-64 could be
            dead by drawn death.</p>

          <p>May be, Mr. Capablanca was not right, but it is evident, that the chess-64 are essencially limited in space
            and &laquo;used up&raquo;; and in mass consciousness, especially in the youth's one the chess does not evoke
            a heightened interest.</p>

          <p>At the same time it is necessary to note, that the chess-64 is an example of optimum, harmonious system,
            and its historical role in human cultural progress during the ages is disputable.</p>

          <p>On the May 30, 1982 the authors Mr. Boris A. Troschichev, Mr. Vasily D.Varkentin, Mr. Yori V. Ribakov and
            Mr. Oleg S. Skaletsky filed with the USSR Patent Office an application for an invention of &laquo;The
            Falconry&raquo; chess. These authors patented &laquo;The Falconry&raquo; in Russia (the design patents No
            42521 and 54537 ).</p>

          <p>The authors are laureates of the Russian and European Academies of natural sciencies and are honoured with
            Pyotr L. Kapitsa and Albert Schweitzer medailles accordingly.</p>

          <p>There were many publications, telecasts and broadcasts about &laquo;The Falconry&raquo;. In 1990-91 two
            annual tournaments took place in Leningrad and Saint Petersburg. It is interesting to note, that in 132
            games only 4 of them were ended in a draw!</p>

          <p>Nowdays the competitions take place too.</p>

          <p>We have champions of Russia. </p>
